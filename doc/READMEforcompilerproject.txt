Read me on how to get Go, Git, and golex set up.

Either install Go (and environment variables will be taken care of)
Or copy the ZIP and run the batch file that Eric gave you.

Run this in the shell to get the go lexer
go get github.com/anneli/golex

the golex repository has a lot of code examples. Check it out.
